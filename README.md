# Java-Projects


This repository contains four Java projects that showcase core Java programming skills, including file handling, array manipulation, game logic, and simple booking systems.

Projects Overview

Project 1:
Read numbers from a file, generate all valid 6-number combinations based on specific rules (even/odd balance, consecutive numbers, common endings, etc.), and save the results to an output file.

Project 3:
Read a text file character-by-character, count the frequency of each Latin letter (A–Z, a–z), and display a frequency table.

Project 4:
A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe (X/O) game for two players, with a full turn-based system, input validation, and automatic win/draw detection.

Project 5:
A simple seat reservation and cancellation system for a 30x12 seating chart (rows 1–30, columns A–L), including user-friendly prompts and validations.
